        <p>Municipality of Tuba, Benguet</p>
        <p>August 3, 2015- September 30, 2015</p>
        <p>Job responsibilities:</p>
        <p>During my internship, I answered emergency calls and travelled to the actual site via either a public-funded or privately owned ambulance to render first aid care before transporting the victim or patient to the nearest hospital or institution of choice. I encountered cases of patients with difficulty of breathing, severe abdominal pain, high fever, in-labor mothers, and victims of motor vehicular accident or stab wounds. During those instances, I quickly administered first aid care and charted the patient‚Äôs history. For every emergency response, a senior team leader was assigned to travel with me. Due to the need for speed, interventions revolved mostly on therapeutic communication, monitoring vital signs, maintaining a patent airway, and applying wound care. It was my responsibility to do head-to-toe assessment and assess neurological status. It took our team to deliver initial care between 5-7 minutes. Upon arrival to the hospital, it was also my responsibility to endorse patients to the nurse on duty in the emergency room. My shift lasted the shortest of 8 hours and extended up to 24 hours depending on the availability of other emergency responders.</p>

        <p>Job responsibilities:</p>
        <p>I handled a terminally ill patient suffering from cancer. During the patient‚Äôs confinement in the hospital, shared joint responsibility with another PDN was done for the care of the patient. I delivered nursing skills such as maintenance of the Central Venous Catheter, flow rate of TPN and IV fluids, titration of dopamine drip to reach the desired systolic pressure, monitoring of vital signs every 30 minutes, maintenance of catheter patency at the cutdown site, administration of osteorized feeding via NGT every 4 hours, and administration of oral and IV medications. My routine also involved updating the significant others of the patient‚Äôs health situation, tracking of inventory supplies, changing bedsheets, performing tepid sponge bath on the patient and changing his clothes as regularly. Endorsement to the next assigned nurse after my shift was also my responsibility. My shift lasted the shortest of 12 hours and extended up to 36 hours depending on the availability of the nurse next on my shift. </p>
